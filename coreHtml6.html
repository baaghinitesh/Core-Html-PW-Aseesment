        <tr>
            <td>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.</td>
            <td>
                <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                    <li><b>BASIC BUILDING BLOCK :- </b> Universal Browser Support. HTML's wide support across all browsers ensures that web pages can be displayed</li>
                    <li><b>ACCESSIBILITY :- </b>Accessibility is an important factor for any website. HTML makes web pages accessible to all people equally. HTML provides semantic tags that help disabled people to use the website easily. They can use tools and devices and easily listen to the content written on the web page.</li>
                    <li><b>COMPATIBILITY :- </b> HTML is compatible with all platforms and browsers. These pages can be accessed anywhere, anytime on any device. HTML is also compatible to be used with other technologies like CSS, Javascript, etc. to make web pages interactive and dynamic.</li>
                    <li><b>SEO FRIENDLY :- </b> The use of proper tags and attributes in HTML pages helps search engines understand the content better. Also, it helps websites to be ranked in the search results. Hence, if we utilize tags properly, it is good for our page rankings.</li>
                    <li><b>RESPONSIVE :- </b> HTML can adapt to different platforms like Mobile, Tablets, etc., and fit device sizes. A single webpage can be viewed on multiple platforms using the same code. Hence, web developers need not write different codes for different devices. HTML automatically detects the device size and adapts it accordingly.</li>

        <tr>
            <td> CSS is a style sheet language used to define the presentation and layout of HTML documents. CSS allows web developers to separate the content and structure of a web page from its appearance, making it easier to control the visual design and layout of a website. By applying CSS rules to HTML elements, developers can change the font, color, spacing, and positioning of elements on a web page.</td>
            <td>
                <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                    <li><b>Website Styling :- </b>CSS is primarily used to style websites, allowing developers to create visually appealing and consistent user interfaces across different web pages.</li>
                    <li><b>Responsive Web Design :- </b>CSS is used to make web pages responsive, adapting the layout and appearance based on the device’s screen size (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).</li>
                    <li><b>Layout Control :- </b>CSS allows developers to control the layout and positioning of elements, such as using grids and flexboxes.</li>
                    <li><b>Custom Themes :- </b>CSS is used to create custom themes for websites, enabling users to choose different styles or skins for the same web application.</li>
                    <li><b>Animations and Transitions :- </b>CSS animations and transitions can be used to add interactivity and enhance user experience on web pages.</li>
                    <li><b>Font Styling :- </b>CSS allows developers to apply custom fonts and control typography for better readability and aesthetics.</li>
                    <li><b>Performance Optimization :- </b>By using CSS efficiently, developers can improve website performance by reducing page load times.</li>

        <tr>
            <td> Java script used by developers to make web pages interactive. It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations, pop-up menus, clickable buttons, control multimedia, etc. The use of JavaScript can be both on the client-side and server-side. While HTML and CSS languages are used to give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript is used to add interactive elements that engage users. Without JavaScript, 90% of Internet webpages would be static.    </td>
            <td>
                <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                    <li><b>Speed :- </b>JavaScript is an “interpreted” language, so it cuts down on the time needed for compilation in other languages like Java. Additionally, it is a client-side script that shortens the time required to establish a server connection, which speeds up program execution.</li>
                    <li><b>Reduces Load on the Server :- </b>The language runs on the client side rather than the server. Thus, the server doesn’t have to deal with the stress of executing JavaScript. Once this burden is reduced, the server will function more quickly and concentrate on other tasks like data management.</li>
                    <li><b>Ease of Use :- </b>JavaScript is one of the simplest languages to learn, particularly for web programming. It has been designed to be simple for web developers to understand and use. Since difficult languages have fewer engineers and demand a higher budget, this helps web companies save a lot of money on development.</li>
                    <li><b>Rich Interface :-</b> JavaScript offers developers a variety of interfaces to build engaging websites. Websites with drag-and-drop elements or sliders may have a more robust user experience. This increases user interaction with the website.</li>
                    <li><b>Extended Functionality :- </b>To save time and money, third-party add-ons such as Greasemonkey (a Mozilla Firefox extension) enable developers to incorporate small sections of prefabricated code into their code. These add-ons make it easier and faster for developers to create JavaScript applications than they could with other coding languages.</li>
