   <div>
    <h2>What is a tech stack?</h2>
    <p>A stack is an arrangement of “things” kept in order one over the other. Tech stacks are sets of technologies that are stacked together to build any application. Popularly known as a technology infrastructure or solutions stack, tech stacks have become essential for building web applications that are easy to maintain and scalable.</p>
   </div>
   <p><b>For example, a web tech stack typically looks something like this:</b></p>

    <h2 style="border: 2px solid DodgerBlue;">Frontend tech stack</h2>
    <p>The frontend tech stack is the client’s side of the application. Client-side refers to anything that a user can see or engage with on a screen. The main concern of the frontend stack is to create a stellar user experience, smooth user interface, and straightforward internal structures. In other words, it is responsible for the design, format, and navigation of websites or web apps.</p>
    <p><b>There are three principal elements of a frontend stack. These are:</b></p>
    <div>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) –</b></dt>
            <dd>it’s a markup language for creating and displaying electronic documents (web pages). They are the backbone in the organization and placement of content on a web page.</dd>
            <dt><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) –</b></dt>
            <dd>It is responsible for the format and layout of the web pages. It includes the font styles, sizes, layout, color, and other aspects of a web page. Developers commonly use frameworks like SASS and LESS to make CSS more manageable and more dynamic.</dd>
            <dt><b>JavaScript –</b> </dt>
            <dd>Used to make web pages interactive. It’s a programming language that allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages; with common libraries and frameworks like jQuery, React, Angular, and Vue. Many modern applications now also use TypeScript instead of basic JavaScript.</dd>
        </dl>
    </div>
    <h2 style="border: 2px solid DodgerBlue;">Backend tech stack</h2>
    <p>The server-side of software development is the backend tech stack. It refers to the inner workings of a website or app that users cannot see. Think of it as the electric power stations that generate electricity for your home. They may seem invisible in the background, but they are important to keep the operations running smoothly.</p>
    <p><b>The backend stack includes these elements:</b></p>
    <div>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Programming languages –</b></dt>
            <dd>This creates logic for apps and websites. The code link the web to a database. Some examples are JavaScript, PHP, and Python.</dd>
            <dt><b>Frameworks –</b></dt>
            <dd>it provides support of applications based on a single programming language. Laravel, Django, and Ruby on Rails are few of the popular frameworks. Most modern applications are built using an MVC style framework.</dd>
            <dt><b>Web Servers –</b></dt>
            <dd>You need backend servers to manage client requests. Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft’s Internet Information Server (IIS) are the most common web servers.</dd>
            <dt><b>Databases –</b></dt>
            <dd>Databases are an integral part of a tech stack. Whether your application is simple or has many workflows, you need a place to store all your information. Some popular databases are MongoDB and MySQL. Modern data platforms like MongoDB further enhance the functionality of a database by providing intelligent querying, aggregation, and transformation features, in addition to data storage and retrieval.</dd>
